<tr> <h3>NBU Services</h3>
    <p3>Newborn babies who need intensive medical care are often put in a special area of the hospital called the neonatal intensive care unit NICU. The NICU has advanced technology and trained healthcare professionals to give special care for our tiniest patients. Our Hospital has a two bed NICU for babies who are not as sick but do need specialized nursing care. Babies who need intensive care do better if they are born in a hospital with a NICU as opposed to being moved after birth.
